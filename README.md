# MiRo
For collaborative development of the MiRo-E demo code

## Getting started
There's just a few things you'll need to do before using this repo for MiRo development:
1. Request access to the repo in the Slack and accept the invite (if you can see this you've already done that!)
2. Clone the repo to a suitable location on your local machine
3. Re-run the MDK installer (at `mdk/bin/deb64/install_mdk.sh`) from the download location to set this version of the MDK as the one your MiRo simulator will run -- if you've previously installed the MDK you may have to remove the current symlink at `~/mdk` first
4. That's it! If you're already familiar with Git, feel free to create a branch for your project and dig in; if you've not used Git before then there's a couple of handy guides linked below, but just ask if you need any help and in general please make sure that any changes are commented and that code merged into the 'master' branch is fully functional.
