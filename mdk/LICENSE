!! Raspbian Linux system and installed packages

The MiRo robot ships with an installation of Raspbian Linux
on the embedded Raspberry Pi computer which includes a set
of installed software packages. This installation is
licensed separately and provided to you without modification
other than to configuration files in the usual way. On
request, we will supply to customers a copy of the source
code of those elements for which it is available (please
note that these sources are available much more immediately
via raspberrypi.org or by downloading direct to your
Raspbian system using the command $apt-get source
&lt;package>$).

Various licenses apply to the system and packages---to see
the license information for individual installed packages,
run the command $grep ^ /usr/share/doc/*/copyright$ on board
the MiRo robot.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Raspberry Pi foundation do
not endorse or promote any products of Consequential
Robotics.
