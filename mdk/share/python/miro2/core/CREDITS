Saliency / priority computations in the biomimetic core owe something to the work of Itti, Koch, and Niebur, around their 1998 article "A Model of Saliency-Based Visual Attention for Rapid Scene Analysis". [[link|http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/730558]]

Decision making in the biomimetic core is based on the work of Gurney, Prescott and Redgrave (and others) on the Basal Ganglia and action selection. See "The basal ganglia: a vertebrate solution to the selection problem?" for a starting point to this work. [[link|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10362291]]

Mammalian vocalisations in the biomimetic core are based on models developed by Professor Roger Moore at The University Of Sheffield. For a starting point on these models, see: Moore, R. K. (2016). "A real-time parametric general-purpose mammalian vocal synthesiser." In INTERSPEECH (pp. 2636-2640). San Francisco, CA. [[link|http://www.interspeech2016.org/Technical-Program]]
